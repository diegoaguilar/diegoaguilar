# Diego Aguilar

Authenticity, humility and professional attitude are the traits that I appreciate and encourage in work

I collaborate as consultant and lead software and cloud architecture projects. Coming from a background in software development, backend, cloud engineering and infrastructure.

Been in the Software Development and Cloud industry for 10 years collaborating in big scale projects that have impact in hundreds of thousands of people for projects of companies like Audible, Amazon Music, Neil Young Archives, Expansión México, Spotify, iHeartRadio and P&G.
