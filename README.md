# Diego Aguilar

I'm a Senior Software Engineer working creating solutions, advising and writing about cloud & data engineering, software architecture and web development. My experience comprehends multiple industries, from media & entertainment, healthcare and finance.

I create digital web products and tools that help creators boost their productivity and focus on what it matters.

Coming from a Computer Science background, I'm also pretty interested in writing, arts and culture. Always eager to get into new areas of knowledge like Psychology, Finance & Economics and Urbanism.
